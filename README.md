# SF_shit_human_or_dog
Are the poops in the famous San Francisco poop maps human or dog feces?

People in San Francisco can report poop to the City, and the city keeps track of these reports, and makes the data public.   People have had fun with the poop reports and created stunning poop map visuals.   And clever people have said clever things about these poop maps.

Its alleged, though that there is an error in the presentation of the poop maps.   That they are offered as marking the location of human poop, when the reports can really be poop from human or animal.

So in one of the shitter data sciece exercises, we will look at if the fecal matter reported is human or animal.  Two approaches present themselves.  First looking at the photo of the poop, and using experience to classify it as human or animal.   For the first 3 poops it might be entertaining, but no, that would be really shitty work.  Secondly, read the description field, and have a python function look for words like dog, human,  and other(s)??
